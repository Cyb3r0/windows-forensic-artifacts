## Artifact Interpretation
Within the `SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services` key you will find subkeys, one for each service installed on an endpoint. 

The values within this key may be interpreted as follows:

| Value | Interpretation |
| --- | --- |
| DisplayName | The name of the service as it would appear in `services.msc` |
| Description | The description of the service as it would appear in `services.msc` |
| ImagePath | The path to the executable for this service |
| Start |  |
| Type |  |

The Last Write Timestamp for each service key represents the time at which the service was installed or modified.
